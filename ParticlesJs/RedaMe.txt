						**		particles.js      **

	it is javascript library used for background unqiue effect and it makes web site attractive.
there is so many libraries of js like type.js,particles.js,anime.js,three.js etc.	

If you want to implement particles.js follow the below steps.

particles.js has no offical site to give more information but on github you found source code and you find demo how it 
works.you have to download this source code from github 
on github there is so many files avaliable there like index.html,css,json,js files.
instead copy all I recommand you to download json file only. and create your own html file
 
after you create html file, define div tag with its like particle-js
and import particle.js and load the particle.json file in script tag 
then you need to start sever start server in particular port and run that html file because we had json file that run on http server.
if you have python install on your computer then then simply write python -m http.server 8000 // this will start server on 8000 port.
